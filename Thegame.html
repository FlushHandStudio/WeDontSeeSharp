                    <h2>What's We Don't See Sharp?</h2>
                    <p class="titles"> 
                    On Halloween night, under a pale moon that seemed to watch their every move, a group of daring friends decided to celebrate the night of frights in the most forbidden way: urban exploration. Their laughter echoed in the darkness as they ventured deeper into an abandoned, forgotten district.
                    That’s when they stumbled upon something unexpected: the eerie entrance to a derelict underground club. The air around it felt icy, heavy with an undefinable stench—a silent warning, perhaps. Yet curiosity, or some unseen force, drove them to cross the threshold.
                    Inside, the atmosphere was thick, suffocating. The walls seemed to ooze forgotten memories, and shadows danced where no light should exist. As they ventured further, their laughter fell silent. And then they saw it—something indescribable. Something that should not be.
                    That night, they would learn that some places do not forgive trespassers. What they saw would scar them forever. Or perhaps not for long... because tonight, the line between their life and their death might just vanish.

          <p>We grouped our personal interests (poker, horror games, puzzles) and we imagined at best a game that we like and that can only please you too!!! The decision-making and imagination were almost instinctive, which allowed us to move forward quickly on this subject. What was more complicated was on the practical and code aspect because we did not yet have all the mechanics of unity and others. But it was our challenge that we decided to take up! </p>

          <p>Throughout the year, our work is evaluated and our goals and thoughts are improved and strengthened. Here are the progresses during the year to understand the steps of creating this game that will make you love poker (or hate it..)</p>

          <p>This game represents us by the imagination of the story but also by the technical work carried out. We encountered difficulties but we also managed to overcome them to prove our motivation and to offer you the best possible game. Here you can find our feelings and our progress during this wonderful project </p>
